# colingourlay's cats

This is my cat.

Cringer is a bit shy; some would say cowardly, but I've always been able to depend on him in a pinch.

By the power of Grayskull, Cringer magically transforms into the fearless tiger, Battle Cat. Not so cowardly now, eh? Also, note the sick mount he has for carrying me around when I want to look like a fucking champ.
